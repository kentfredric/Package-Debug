 - runtime_switchable feature removed in favour of more general purpose
   code, that is performant even *with* runtime switchability being on by

 - Class methods starting with full_ removed as they're no longer used.
 - Additionally, loading `Readonly` to implement above feaures usually
   costed more than it saved.

   execute during ->import() whereas previously it was more like ~500
   statements.
